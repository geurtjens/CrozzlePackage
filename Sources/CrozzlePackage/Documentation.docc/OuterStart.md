# OuterStart

This is how we handle those words in a cluster that are not leading or trailing but have the interlock in the middle of the word

## Overview

We need to have another array containing the outerStart values.  The outerStart values are those that tell where the words first interlock starts at.  Its like the first interlock letter but in the trailing one we do not update it, we only need it for the outer pattern.
